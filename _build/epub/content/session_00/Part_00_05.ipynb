The size of it is overwhelming, 48 metres long, 25 metres in diameter, in a cavern the size of a cathedral, and the whole thing built 100 metres underground. ATLAS sits in the 27 kilometre ring at CERN and it’s here that protons at nearly the speed of light smash into one another. *;\n",

    "__PIPPA WELLS::__ *That’s right. So bunches coming in from this side, same thing coming in from the other side. Forty million packets of protons every second have a chance to collide in the middle of the detector. And something like 20 of those protons will interact. So we’re looking at the remnants of what was briefly created in the middle, and then those remnants fly out in all directions. *;\n",

    "__NARRATOR::__ *So you’re saying two protons hit, there’s a fireball, a massive, or minute, explosion. *;\n",

The next challenge is getting the information out, down 50,000 separate cables. *;\n",

    "Einstein’s most famous equation and in fact arguably the most famous equation in history tells us that mass (*m*) and energy (*E*) are interchangeable via E=m⁢  c2, where *c* is the speed of light, 3.00 × 10<sup xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">8</sup> m s<sup xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">–1</sup>. The energies involved are usually expressed in terms of a unit called the __electronvolt__. As a result, it’s also convenient to refer to the masses of subatomic particles in terms of their energy equivalence. For instance, the mass of an electron is about 9.1 × 10<sup xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">–31</sup> kg. The energy equivalent of this mass is given by Einstein’s equation:\n",
    "E=mc2=(9.1×10−31)×(3×108)2=(8.19×10−14)kgm2s2\n",
    "One electronvolt is defined to be 1.602×10−19J\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, E=(8.19×10−14)(1.602×10−19)=511236 eV, over 510 thousand electronvolts, or 510 keV (kilo electronvolts). The term ‘mass energy’ is often used to refer to this energy equivalent of the mass of a particle. Similarly, the mass energy of either a proton or neutron is around 940 MeV (940 mega electronvolts or 940 million electronvolts).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of the high-energy reactions that can occur inside ATLAS, when a proton with kinetic energy of several hundred MeV collides with another proton or a neutron, new hadrons, such as pions, can be created. \n",
    "\n",
    "In such processes, some of the kinetic energy of the protons is converted into mass, via the familiar equation E=m⁢  c2, and so appears in the form of new particles. As you have learned, the pions that are created come in three varieties:\n",

    "#### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Pions and nucleons contain only up and down quarks, so these are the only ‘raw materials’ available from which to build the new hadron. To get a charge of +2*e* requires three up quarks (+2e3+2e3+2e3=+2e). This hadron can be formed by the collision of π<sup xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">+</sup>, (ud¯), with a proton, (uud), followed by the annihilation of d with d¯. As the hadron contains three quarks (uuu), it is a baryon. \n",

    "The outcome from a high-energy collision between, say, two protons is subject to quantum indeterminacy in several ways. Imagine that two protons collide with a total kinetic energy of 200 MeV. This is enough energy to make a pion and still have a little energy left over to provide kinetic energy of the products. But what exactly will the products be? In fact there are two possibilities in this case: \n",

    "<tbody><tr>\n",
    "<td class=\"highlight_\" rowspan=\"\" colspan=\"\">p+p→p+p+π0</td>\n",
    "<td class=\"highlight_\" rowspan=\"\" colspan=\"\">p+p→p+n+π+</td>\n",
    "</tr></tbody>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these possibilities will occur, and there is no way of predicting which one will be the outcome of a particular reaction. The rules that must be obeyed in these reactions are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* energy is conserved (as usual) \n",
    "\n",
    "* electric charge is conserved (as usual) \n",
    "\n",
    "* the number of quarks minus the number of antiquarks is conserved. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now look at each of these rules in more detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, look at the conservation of energy, which the rules say must be conserved. There is 200 MeV of available kinetic energy, and 140 MeV is used up in creating the pion in each case. This leaves 60 MeV for kinetic energy of the products. It’s not possible that two pions can be created as that would require at least 2 × 140 MeV = 280 MeV of kinetic energy from the reactants. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second rule is that electric charge is conserved. In the two proton reactions, the net electric charge of the reactants is twice that of a proton in each case. The net electric charge of the products in the two cases is also twice that of a proton, so electric charge is conserved in both cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the third rule says that the number of quarks minus the number of antiquarks is conserved. In the two proton reactions, the reactants are composed of 3 quarks for each proton and no antiquarks, so the number of quarks minus the number of antiquarks is 6 for the reactants. In the products, the number of quarks is 3 for each proton or neutron and 1 for each pion, while the number of antiquarks is 1 for each pion. The number of quarks minus the number of antiquarks in the products is therefore (3 + 3 + 1 − 1) = 6. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, all three rules are indeed obeyed in both reactions. \n",

    "When two neutrons collide with a combined kinetic energy of 300 MeV, this is enough energy to make two pions (with mass energy 140 MeV each). In addition, all the possible reactions to make only one pion can also occur.\n",

    "In conclusion, just as electrons, protons and neutrons simplify the elements to their essentials, so a new layer of apparent complexity can be understood by the quark model. However, there is a crucial difference. If an atom is hit hard enough, electrons come out. If a nucleus is hit hard enough, nucleons come out. But if a nucleon is hit hard with another nucleon, quarks do not come out. Instead the kinetic energy is converted into the mass of new hadrons. "
